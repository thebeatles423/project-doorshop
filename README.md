# Project Doorshop (UNSTABLE!)
THIS CODE IS BROKEN. SETTINGS.JSON IS FUCKED.



I'm going to warn you, this build is extremely unstable.
Also, this is a very heavily edited version of BonziWORLD.
## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/joseph14078/BonziWORLD
cd BonziWORLD
```

### Client
```
cd src
npm install
grunt build_www
cd ..
```

### Server
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
